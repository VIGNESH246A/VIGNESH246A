## 🚀 About Me  

I’m a **Civil Engineering graduate (2023)** pivoting into the world of **Data Science**.  
Currently learning through **GUVI’s Data Science program**, I’m building strong foundations in:  

- **Programming** (Python, SQL)  
- **Data Analysis** (Excel, Pandas, NumPy, Power BI)  
- **Machine Learning** (Scikit-learn, Regression, Classification, Clustering)  
- **Data Visualization** (Plotly, Power BI, Excel)  

My goal is to evolve into a **Data Scientist** and eventually into an **AI/ML Engineer**, applying data-driven solutions to solve **real-world problems**.
